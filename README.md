# TomJerry-Scratch
First Scratch project - Tom need kisses

This is my very first project that I made back in 2020. It was part of cs50 by harvard. I have always ejoyed watching Tom & Jerry. Who doesn't? it was not just a show but reflection of our childhood. A 90's kid would know the emotion. That eagerly, patiently waiting after lunch to watch Tom & Jerry on Cartoon Network/MBC3/Nickelodeon at 4pm. Sad, even Cartoon Network is no longer with us. Today we can simply watch it on youtube but that emotion and enthusiasm is no more. 

The game was made on scratch. Jerry runs away with cheese and you (TOM) need kisses.
