# TomJerry-Scratch
First Scratch project - Tom need kisses

This is my very first project that I made back in 2020. It was part of cs50 by harvard. I have always ejoyed watching Tom & Jerry. Who doesn't? it was not just a show but reflection of our childhood. A 90's kid would know that emotion. That eagerly, patiently waiting after lunch to watch Tom & Jerry on Cartoon Network/MBC3/Nickelodeon at 4pm.

The game was made on scratch. Jerry runs away with cheese and you (TOM) need kisses.
